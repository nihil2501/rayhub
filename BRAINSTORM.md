### Future extensions
#### Domain extensions
* Model more kinds of signals
* More kinds of devices
* More summary statistics
* Associate devices with essential attributes
	- (latitude, longitude)
	- object_id: this device is associated with measuring some particular object
* Anomolous _device_ behavior detection
  - Device behavior rather than phenomenon behavior so that this component concerns device operation per se. Detection afforded by having two devices read the same phenomenon for instance.
#### Technical extensions
* Persistence
* Event driven design
* Replayability
